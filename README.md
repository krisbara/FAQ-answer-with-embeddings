# FAQ-answer-with-embeddings

## Project Description

**FAQ-answer-with-embeddings** is a tool that transforms Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) into embeddings using the `get_embedding.py` script. By leveraging embedding algorithms, the tool processes user input, converts it into embeddings, calculates the embedding distances, and returns the most appropriate response using the `main.py` script. This project is particularly useful for automating the process of finding relevant answers to user queries by utilizing the power of embeddings.
